# NYCDSA-Project1

#This project aimed at using data analyis to find the ultimate vanill cake recipe for my cake business. I scraped the Food Network (fnwebscrape.py) to extract all searches
#for vanilla, white, yellow, lemon cakes and analyzed them based on cost, calories, and reviews (FNdatacleaner.py) I narrowed thousands of recipes to about 5 to try.
